CCTV using a webcam and a raspberry pi using python.

This is a school student project for a raspberry pi - to make an automatic security CCTV system in order to try to cut down on graffiti in an exclusion room in school.

It's designed to be used to take a regular picture from a webcam and save it in a specified folder.

Before using this project, it's worth reading the legal guidelines on using CCTV in schools: You can find a useful summary here: http://www.atl.org.uk/help-and-advice/school-and-college/CCTV.asp
